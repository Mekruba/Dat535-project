    "This notebook serves as the main file for the DAT535 project. It processes data from `anime-dataset-2023.csv`, which contains comprehensive information about anime from MyAnimeList (MAL).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook extracts and filters the data, preparing it for training a simple linear regression model. The model predicts anime scores based on features such as genre and studio, among others. Given the dataset size of approximately 15 MB, it was also used light-load benchmark for processing and analysis, while calulating average animme score from user score is the heavy load bemchmark(`average_anime_score.ipynb`).\n",

    "### Light Load Benchmark: Anime Dataset Cleaning and Score prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on performing a light load benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of PySpark in handling smaller datasets with moderate computational requirements. The primary goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze an anime dataset to extract meaningful insights and prepare it for machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is divided into two key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - The raw anime dataset is cleaned to handle multiline records, escape special characters, and normalize field counts.\n",
    "   - Selected columns are extracted, and the dataset is saved in a structured format for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - The cleaned dataset is processed to compute average scores for genres and studios, transforming string-based fields into numerical representations.\n",
    "   - These features are structured into labeled datasets, making them suitable for predictive modeling.\n",

    "### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Section\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw anime dataset for further analysis. The key steps performed are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spark Session Configuration**: \n",
    "   A Spark session is initialized with specific configurations for memory, cores, and instances to handle distributed data processing efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Loading**: \n",
    "   The dataset is loaded as an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) from a CSV file. The header row is identified and excluded from the main dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiline Record Cleaning**: \n",
    "   Multiline records in the dataset are identified and combined into single records using a cleaning function. This ensures that each record corresponds to a single line, preventing parsing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quote Handling and Parsing**: \n",
    "   A custom function is used to handle embedded quotes and escape characters within fields. This ensures proper parsing of the dataset while maintaining the integrity of quoted fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Field Normalization**: \n",
    "   Each record is normalized to ensure it contains exactly 24 fields:\n",
    "   - Missing fields are padded with `None`.\n",
    "   - Excess fields are consolidated into the last field.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **RDD to DataFrame Conversion**: \n",
    "   The cleaned and parsed RDD is converted into a Spark DataFrame, using the original header as column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **DataFrame Preview and Storage**: \n",
    "   The resulting DataFrame is previewed to verify the cleaning process and saved as a cleaned CSV file for downstream tasks. The file is written with headers, and internal quotes are properly escaped.\n",

By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.  Spike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.  While developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |TV   |26.0    |Apr 3, 1998 to Apr 24, 1999 |spring 1998|Finished Airing |Bandai Visual                                                                            |Funimation, Bandai Entertainment                          |Sunrise                     |Original   |24 min per ep|R - 17+ (violence & profanity)|41.0  |43        |78525    |914193.0 |1771505|https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/19644.jpg    |\n",

However, as a result of running errands throughout his life, Sena has become agile and developed a skill for avoiding crowds of people. After the cunning Youichi Hiruma—captain of the Deimon Devil Bats football team—witnesses Sena's rapid legs in motion, he coerces the timid boy into joining his squad.  As Hiruma wants to conceal Sena's identity from other clubs, Sena is forced to hide under the visored helmet of \"Eyeshield 21,\" a mysterious running back wearing the number 21 jersey. The legendary Eyeshield 21 can supposedly run at the speed of light and has achieved remarkable feats in the United States during his time at the Notre Dame College.

That is until one night, a seemingly small event changes Dr. Tenma's life forever. While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.  So when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director.  Nine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on. He must now embark on a quest of pursuit to make amends for the havoc spread by the one he saved.                                                                                                                                                             |TV   |74.0    |Apr 7, 2004 to Sep 28, 2005 |spring 2004|Finished Airing |VAP, Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions, Nippon Television Network                          |VIZ Media                                                 |Madhouse                    |Manga      |24 min per ep|R+ - Mild Nudity              |26.0  |142       |47235    |368569.0 |1013100|https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/18793.jpg   |\n",

The once fair population has been left to cling to the inhospitable dunes for survival. At least, that is the case for normal people. For those who have spent a little too long in the Kanto sun, the desert offers a wondrous opportunity to make a name for themselves.  One such person is the masked handyman \"Sunabouzu,\" or Desert Punk, who has forged a legendary reputation for always finishing his jobs, no matter the nature or cost. Cunning and ruthless, he has become a force of crude destruction to the other desert people. However, the \"Vixen of the Desert,\" Junko Asagiri, discovers that Sunabouzu is not without his weaknesses—he is easily swayed by his insatiable lust for large-breasted desert babes.  Following their chaotic adventures through the Kanto Desert, Sunabouzu features a bizarre cast of personalities who entertain themselves with senseless violence and perversion in a world long destroyed by their forefathers. And just like them, they have not learned a damn thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |TV   |24.0    |Oct 6, 2004 to Mar 30, 2005 |fall 2004  |Finished Airing |GDH, Pony Canyon, CBC Television                                                         |Funimation                                                |Gonzo                       |Manga      |24 min per ep|R - 17+ (violence & profanity)|2167.0|1546      |822      |53709.0  |134894 |https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75536.jpg    |\n",

Available only in Lux, this rare substance is the basis of \"texhnolyze\" transplants that permit humans to replace parts of their body with cybernetic prostheses. The latter have the particularity not to trigger an immune response in their hosts and the \"Class\" has the privilege to conduct research on them. This elusive organization, also in charge of the raffia production, delegates its executive authority to a group called Organo led by Keigo Oonishi—a self-righteous man with texhnolyzed legs who is rumored to hear the \"voice of the city.\"  The fragile balance of powers in Lux is disturbed when a mysterious visitor named Kazuho Yoshii begins committing a series of crimes that puts the gangs at each other's throats. In the midst of the chaos, new actors emerge: Ichise, an ex-boxer mutilated by Organo and recently texhnolyzed by Eriko \"Doc\" Kamata; and Ran, a young florist who can see the future.

The continuous confrontations between the races have split the world into separate factions. The race of vampires, Methuselah, are affiliated with the New Human Empire; whereas the humans, deemed Terrans by the vampires, make up the Vatican Papal State. Furthermore, extremist groups like the Rosenkreuz Order strive to rekindle a war, despite the factions' attempts to avoid direct conflict.  To combat terrorist organizations, the Vatican has implemented the AX unit. Led by Cardinal Caterina Sforza, the AX agents investigate vampire-related disturbances with hopes that the Terrans and the Methuselah will one day achieve peaceful coexistence. Amongst the AX unit is priest Abel Nightroad—a seemingly disoriented but gentle-hearted fellow who is a fierce vampire slayer on the battlefield. Joining the unit as his partner is agent Sister Esther Blanchett, a brave and gentle young nun troubled with a tragic past.

While the others are no match for Guts, Griffith defeats him in one blow.  Incapacitated and taken into the Band of the Falcon's camp to recover, Guts wakes up two days later.

Due to great improvements in cybernetics, its citizens are able to replace their limbs with robotic parts. The world is now more interconnected than ever before, and the city's Public Security Section 9 is responsible for combating corruption, terrorism, and other dangerous threats following this shift toward globalization.  The strong-willed Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9 spearheads a case involving a mysterious hacker known only as the \"Puppet Master,\" who leaves a trail of victims stripped of their memories. Like many in this futuristic world, the Puppet Master's body is almost entirely robotic, giving them incredible power.  As Motoko and her subordinates follow the enigmatic criminal's trail, other parties—including Section 6—start to get involved, forcing her to confront the extremely complicated nature of the case.

An explosion caused by a young boy with psychic powers tears through the city of Tokyo and ignites the fuse that leads to World War III. In order to prevent any further destruction, he is captured and taken into custody, never to be heard from again. Now, in the year 2019, a restored version of the city known as Neo-Tokyo—an area rife with gang violence and terrorism against the current government—stands in its place. Here, Shoutarou Kaneda leads \"the Capsules,\" a group of misfits known for riding large, custom motorcycles and being in constant conflict with their rivals \"the Clowns.\"  During one of these battles, Shoutarou's best friend Tetsuo Shima is caught up in an accident with an esper who finds himself in the streets of Tokyo after escaping confinement from a government institution. Through this encounter, Tetsuo begins to develop his own mysterious abilities, as the government seeks to quarantine this latest psychic in a desperate attempt to prevent him from unleashing the destructive power that could once again bring the city to its knees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Movie|1.0     |Jul 16, 1988                |UNKNOWN    |Finished Airing |Mainichi Broadcasting System, Kodansha, Toho, Streamline Pictures                        |Funimation, Bandai Entertainment, Geneon Entertainment USA|Tokyo Movie Shinsha         |Manga      |2 hr 4 min   |R+ - Mild Nudity              |389.0 |208       |12961    |485580.0 |804581 |https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1408/114012.jpg|\n",

He does not know what he has previously done before he woke up. In The World, the Crimson Knights suspects him of being a hacker, as he was seen accompanying a tweaked character in the form of a cat. Unable to log out from the game, he wanders around looking for answers, avoiding the knights and other players he meets along the way.  As Tsukasa explores The World, he stumbles upon a magical item that takes the form of a \"guardian,\" which promises him protection from all harm.

    "\n",
    "This section focuses on processing a cleaned anime dataset, filtering out invalid records, and restructuring it for further analysis. The key steps performed are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**:\n",
    "   The cleaned dataset is loaded as an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) from a CSV file. The header row is identified and excluded from the main data for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Line Processing**:\n",
    "   Each line in the dataset is processed to:\n",
    "   - Remove null characters to prevent parsing errors.\n",
    "   - Parse the fields using a CSV reader to handle embedded quotes and other formatting issues.\n",
    "   - Log problematic lines for debugging while ensuring data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filtering Invalid Rows**:\n",
    "   Rows with specific fields marked as \"UNKNOWN\" are filtered out. This ensures that only valid records with meaningful data are retained for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Field Selection and Transformation**:\n",
    "   Selected fields from each record are extracted and transformed:\n",
    "   - Commas in text fields like `name`, `genre`, and `studios` are replaced with semicolons to avoid issues during CSV serialization.\n",
    "   - Key features such as `anime_id`, `score`, `rank`, and `popularity` are preserved for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verification**:\n",
    "   A sample of 10 processed rows is taken and printed to validate the correctness of the processing steps. This provides a quick check to ensure the transformations are applied as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DataFrame Creation**:\n",
    "   The processed RDD is converted into a Spark DataFrame with a predefined schema, making the data structured and suitable for analysis or storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Saving the Processed Dataset**:\n",
    "   The resulting DataFrame is saved as a new CSV file. The file includes headers, and any internal quotes in the fields are properly escaped. The overwrite mode ensures that any existing file at the output path is replaced with the new dataset.\n",

    "### Feature Engineering for Genres and Studios\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on transforming the trimmed anime dataset into a format suitable for machine learning by engineering features based on genres, studios, and other relevant attributes. Below is a summary of the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**:\n",
    "   The trimmed dataset is loaded as an RDD, and the header row is identified and excluded. This ensures that only valid data records are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computing Average Scores for Genres and Studios**:\n",
    "   - Genres and studios are extracted from each record as key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the genre or studio, and the value is a tuple of the anime's score and a count of 1.\n",
    "   - These pairs are aggregated to calculate the total score and occurrence count for each genre and studio.\n",
    "   - The average score is then computed by dividing the total score by the count. The results are stored in a dictionary for efficient lookup during feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Transformation**:\n",
    "   - Each line in the dataset is processed to extract relevant fields such as `rank`, `popularity`, `favorites`, and `members`.\n",
    "   - Rank and popularity are transformed into scaled features using predefined maximum values.\n",
    "   - Average scores for genres and studios are retrieved from the dictionary and combined if multiple genres or studios are associated with an anime.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating Labeled Features**:\n",
    "   - A labeled feature vector is created for each anime record, containing transformed features and a label (the anime's score).\n",
    "   - This ensures the data is structured for use in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verification**:\n",
    "   - A sample of 10 processed rows is printed to validate that the feature engineering process is functioning as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DataFrame Creation**:\n",
    "   - The processed RDD is converted into a Spark DataFrame, where each row contains a dense vector of features and the corresponding label.\n",
    "   - This structured format is ideal for training machine learning models in PySpark or exporting for use in other frameworks.\n",

    "### Linear Regression Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on training a linear regression model using the processed dataset, evaluating its predictions, and visualizing the results. Below are the key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train-Test Split**:\n",
    "   The dataset is randomly split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training the model and 20% reserved for evaluation. This ensures the model is trained and tested on separate subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   A linear regression model is initialized with a regularization parameter (`regParam`) to control overfitting. The model is then trained on the training data, learning the relationship between the features and the label (anime scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Making Predictions**:\n",
    "   The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data. The resulting predictions include both the actual labels and the predicted values, allowing for evaluation of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Collection for Visualization**:\n",
    "   The predicted and actual values are collected from the test data and split into two lists for visualization purposes. This step prepares the data for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scatter Plot of Predictions**:\n",
    "   A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between the actual and predicted values:\n",
    "   - Each point represents a pair of actual and predicted scores.\n",
    "   - A reference line is added to indicate perfect prediction, providing a visual benchmark for model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Plot Customization**:\n",
    "   The plot is enhanced with titles, axis labels, a legend, and a grid to make it informative and easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Stopping the Spark Session**:\n",
    "   The Spark session is stopped to release resources after completing the processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n"
