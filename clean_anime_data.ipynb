Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.

His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.  So when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director.

The idea of Project D is to challenge street racing teams from other prefectures to improve both their uphill and downhill records. In order to attract the attention of the best racing teams| Ryousuke creates a dedicated website to announce the future battles of Project D and post the team's results.  The fourth season of Initial D details the hardships and successes of the members of Project D as they try to become the best street racing team outside of Gunma Prefecture.\"\"\"|TV                                                                                                                             |24.0                                                                                                                                                                                             |\"\"\"Apr 17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2004 to Feb 18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2006\"\"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |spring 2004                                                                                                                                      |Finished Airing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\"\"\"OB Planning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Studio Jack\"\"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |Funimation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |A.C.G.T.                                                                                                            |Manga                                                                                                                                                                                           |27 min per ep                                                                                                                                                                         |PG-13 - Teens 13 or older                                                                                                                                   |\n",
